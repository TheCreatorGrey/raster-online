        <h1>Raster Online Documentation</h1>
        <span>
            Keep in mind that while this tool is capable of handling
            high resolution images, it is designed for pixel art. If 
            you use high resolution images, you may experience 
            performance issues. <br><br>

            This document will go through every feature in this tool
            and explain their purposes and uses. This documentation
            goes into great detail and assumes you have never used
            image editing software before.

        <h2>Navigation: Work Area</h2>
        <span>
            The work area can be navigated using the mouse.
            To pan the work area, hold middle click and drag.
            To zoom in or out of the work area, use the scroll wheel.
        </span>

        <br><br><br>

        <h2>Navigation: Sidebar</h2>
        <span>
            On the bottom left of the screen, there will be a panel 
            with many buttons and other elements.

            <h3>Tool Area</h3>
            On the top of this sidebar, there is a grid of buttons.
            Each of these buttons represent tools that can be used.
            Clicking one of these buttons will change the active
            tool setting. See more on tools below.
            
            <h3>Color Picker</h3>
            The next segment of the panel is the color picker.
            There are four sliders which you can click and drag
            to change the values of. Each slider represents red,
            green, blue and transparency respectively. On the top
            bar, you can see a preview of the current color on
            the left.
            
            <h3>Document Configuration</h3>
            On the next segment of the panel is document configuration.
            You can control the document's width and height using their
            respective inputs in this section. For the time being, this
            is the only configuration that exists in this segment.

            <h3>File Importing and Exporting</h3>
            Finally, there are two buttons at the bottom of the sidebar.
            The "Import" button will open a file dialog and allow you to
            import an image file.
            The "Save" button will download a PNG of your current project.

        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <span>
            Tools are relatively self-explanitory. You can click and drag on
            the work area to make changes to the canvas. What happens depends
            on which tool you are using. Most tools will use the color
            selected by the color picker. The terms "starting point" and 
            "ending point" will be referenced throughout this section,
            referring to the point where your mouse is pressed and released
            respectively.

            <h3>Draw</h3>
            This tool will allow you to draw a line using your mouse. I don't 
            think further explanation is needed here.

            <h3>Line</h3>
            This tool will create a 2 point straight line between the starting
            point and ending point.

            <h3>Rect</h3>
            This tool will create a rectangle between the starting and ending point.

            <h3>Rect</h3>
            This tool will create a rectangle between the starting and ending point.

            <h3>Circle</h3>
            This tool will draw a solid circle using the starting point as the center
            and the ending point as the radius.

            <h3>Fill</h3>
            This is one of few tools that uses a single click instead of a click and
            drag. Sets the color of any clicked "shape" or "region" to the selected 
            color. Works the same as the "fill" function in any other raster program.

            <h3>Replace</h3>
            This tool also uses a single click instead of dragging. Upon clicking, 
            any pixel with the same color as the pixel that was clicked will be 
            changed to the selected color.

            <h3>Select</h3>
            This tool uses two clicks and drags. The first "stage" is selection;
            a purple rectangle will indicate the area you are selecting, between
            the starting and ending point. After a selection is made, you can
            click and drag the selection to its new position on the canvas.
            While dragging, the orange rectangle will indicate the original
            position of the selection.

            <h3>Filter tools</h3>
            All tools below are "filter" tools. When using these tools, a pink
            rectangle will indicate the filter region between the starting and
            ending points. Each filter will have a different effect on this
            region of pixels once the mouse is released.

            <h3>Lighten</h3>
            A filter which lightens the color of affected pixels.

            <h3>Darken</h3>
            A filter which darkens the color of affected pixels.

            <h3>Stipple</h3>
            A filter which alternates affected pixels between their original
            colors and transparency like a checkerboard.

            <h3>Noise</h3>
            A filter which changes the brightness of affected pixels based
            on random values.

            <h3>Clear</h3>
            Erases the affected area.
