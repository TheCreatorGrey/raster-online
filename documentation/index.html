            <h1>Raster Online Documentation</h1>
            <span>
                Keep in mind that while this tool is generally optimized
                enough to handle high resolution images, it is designed 
                for pixel art. If you use high resolution images, you 
                may experience performance issues. <br><br>

                While drawing tablets are supported, this documentation 
                assumes you are using a mouse, so terms like "left click" 
                and "right click" will be used. If you are using a drawing
                tablet or touch device, you will need to use the equivalent
                of the mouse button mentioned. <br><br>
    
                This document will go through every feature in this tool
                and explain their purposes and uses. This documentation
                goes into great detail and assumes you have never used
                image editing software before.

            <h2>Navigation: Work Area</h2>
            <span>
                The work area can be navigated using the mouse or pointer.
                To pan the work area, hold middle click and drag. To zoom 
                in or out of the work area, use the scroll wheel.
            </span>
    
            <br><br><br>
    
            <h2>Navigation: Sidebar</h2>
            <span>
                On the bottom left of the screen, there will be a panel 
                with many buttons and other elements.
    
                <h3>Tool Area</h3>
                On the top of this sidebar, there is a grid of buttons.
                Each of these buttons represent tools that can be used.
                Clicking one of these buttons will change the active
                tool setting. See more on tools below.
                
                <h3>Color Picker</h3>
                The next segment of the panel is the color picker.
                There are four sliders which you can click and drag
                to change the values of. Each slider represents red,
                green, blue and transparency (or alpha) respectively. 
                On the top bar, you can see a preview of the current 
                color on the left.
                
                <h3>Document Configuration</h3>
                On the next segment of the panel is document configuration.
                You can control the document's width and height using their
                respective inputs in this section. For the time being, this
                is the only configuration that exists in this segment.
    
                <h3>File Importing and Exporting</h3>
                Finally, there are two buttons at the bottom of the sidebar.
                The "Import" button will open a file dialog and allow you to
                import an image file.
                The "Save" button will download a PNG of your current project.
            </span>
    
            <br><br><br>
    
            <h2>Tools</h2>
            <span>
                Using tools, you can make changes to the canvas. Some tools will 
                require you to click and drag to use, while others only need a click.
                What happens depends on which tool you are using. Most tools will use 
                the color selected by the color picker. The terms "starting point" and 
                "ending point" will be referenced throughout this section,
                referring to the point where your mouse or pointer is pressed and released
                respectively.
    
                <h3>Draw</h3>
                Draws a multi-point line following your cursor.
    
                <h3>Erase</h3>
                Clears pixels following the cursor.
    
                <h3>Line</h3>
                This tool will create a 2-point straight line between the starting
                point and ending point.
    
                <h3>Rect</h3>
                This tool will create a rectangle between the starting and ending point.
    
                <h3>Circle</h3>
                This tool will draw a solid circle using the starting point as the center
                and the ending point as the radius.
    
                <h3>Fill</h3>
                This is one of few tools that uses a single click instead of a click and
                drag. Sets the color of any clicked "shape" or "region" to the selected 
                color. Works the same as the "fill" function in any other raster program.
    
                <h3>Replace</h3>
                This tool also uses a single click instead of dragging. Upon clicking, 
                any pixel with the same color as the pixel that was clicked will be 
                changed to the selected color.
    
                <h3>Clear</h3>
                When clicked over the canvas, this tool will clear the entire canvas.
            </span>
    
            <br><br><br>
    
            <h2>Selection</h2>
            <span>
                You can select a region of pixels and move, clone or
                apply filters to them.
    
                <h3>Mouse Control</h3>
                To create a selection, hold right-click and drag across the
                canvas. A purple rectangle will indicate your selection.
                To move the selection, left-click on the selected region
                and drag to the desired place. As you move the selection, 
                an orange rectangle will indicate the original position
                of the selection.
    
                <h3>Context Menu</h3>
                When you have made a selection, a menu will appear next
                to the top-right corner of the selection. The "Export Selection"
                button will download the selection to an image file.
                The section below it allows you to apply "filters" to your
                selection. See more on filters below.
            </span>
    
            <br><br><br>
    
            <h2>Filters</h2>
            <span>
                Filters allow you to change the look of the pixels in a
                selection. Each button in the above-mentioned context menu
                under the filter section will apply a filter to the selection.
    
                The functions of each are listed below:
    
                <h3>Brighten</h3>
                Brightens the color of affected pixels by 8.
    
                <h3>Darken</h3>
                Darkens the color of affected pixels by 8.

                <h3>Greyscale</h3>
                Applies greyscale or "black and white" to affected pixels.

                <h3>Tint</h3>
                Changes the color of affected pixels to shades of
                the selected color.
    
                <h3>Dither</h3>
                Alternates affected pixels between their original
                colors and transparency like a checkerboard.
    
                <h3>Noise</h3>
                Changes the brightness of affected pixels based
                on random values.

                <h3>Lines</h3>
                Sets affected dark pixels to black and clears the rest.
    
                <h3>Clear</h3>
                Clears all affected pixels.
